FUNCTIONS
    asctime(...)
        asctime([tuple]) -> string

        Convert a time tuple to a string, e.g. 'Sat Jun 06 16:26:11 1998'.
        When the time tuple is not present, current time as returned by localtime()
        is used.

    clock(...)
        clock() -> floating point number

        Return the CPU time or real time since the start of the process or since
        the first call to clock().  This has as much precision as the system
        records.

    ctime(...)
        ctime(seconds) -> string

        Convert a time in seconds since the Epoch to a string in local time.
        This is equivalent to asctime(localtime(seconds)). When the time tuple is
        not present, current time as returned by localtime() is used.

    gmtime(...)
        gmtime([seconds]) -> (tm_year, tm_mon, tm_mday, tm_hour, tm_min,
                               tm_sec, tm_wday, tm_yday, tm_isdst)

        Convert seconds since the Epoch to a time tuple expressing UTC (a.k.a.
        GMT).  When 'seconds' is not passed in, convert the current time instead.

    localtime(...)
        localtime([seconds]) -> (tm_year,tm_mon,tm_mday,tm_hour,tm_min,
                                  tm_sec,tm_wday,tm_yday,tm_isdst)

        Convert seconds since the Epoch to a time tuple expressing local time.
        When 'seconds' is not passed in, convert the current time instead.

    mktime(...)
        mktime(tuple) -> floating point number

        Convert a time tuple in local time to seconds since the Epoch.

    sleep(...)
        sleep(seconds)

        Delay execution for a given number of seconds.  The argument may be
        a floating point number for subsecond precision.

    strftime(...)
        strftime(format[, tuple]) -> string

        Convert a time tuple to a string according to a format specification.
        See the library reference manual for formatting codes. When the time tuple
        is not present, current time as returned by localtime() is used.

    strptime(...)
        strptime(string, format) -> struct_time

        Parse a string to a time tuple according to a format specification.
        See the library reference manual for formatting codes (same as strftime()).

    time(...)
        time() -> floating point number

        Return the current time in seconds since the Epoch.
        Fractions of a second may be present if the system clock provides them.

    tzset(...)
        tzset()

        Initialize, or reinitialize, the local timezone to the value stored in
        os.environ['TZ']. The TZ environment variable should be specified in
        standard Unix timezone format as documented in the tzset man page
        (eg. 'US/Eastern', 'Europe/Amsterdam'). Unknown timezones will silently
        fall back to UTC. If the TZ environment variable is not set, the local
        timezone is set to the systems best guess of wallclock time.
        Changing the TZ environment variable without calling tzset *may* change
        the local timezone used by methods such as localtime, but this behaviour
        should not be relied on.
